        <h2>Idea</h2>
        <p>
            This project is going to be the framework for a web-development-tutorial.<br>
            <br>
            The website currently has just a few pages about <a href="html/html.html">HTML</a> and <a href="html/css.html">CSS</a>, but it is build to be easily extended.<br>
            The header as well as the sidebar in the html section already hold dummy pages to show the potential of this guide.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking of those elements, the user can access different parts of the tutorial via the header or the sidebar within a language.
        </p>
        <br>
        <hr class="separator">
        <h2>Development & Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>The following paragraphs are a summary of all the milestones of this project.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>index.html</h3>
        <p>
            Every webpage starts with the <span class="mark">index.html</span>.<br>
            Albeit the section you're currently reading was added bit by bit later on in the development.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Header & sidenav</h3>
        <p>
            The header was up next being the first big element on the website.<br>
            The biggest problem creating it, was the arrangement of the elements (icons & texts) and the <span class="mark">text-align</span> and <span class="mark">vertical-align</span> within them. Building the sidenav was very similar.<br>
            <br>
            A small issue was with <span class="mark">position: fixed</span> of both elements. First working with <span class="mark">position: sticky</span> lead to a few overlaps and ugly behaviours.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>
            Due to wrong/bad css the header was always just as big as the biggest child it contained, which caused ugly effects later on.<br>
            Another funny bug was content scrolling over the fixed header. This was fixed with a <span class="mark">z-index</span>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Dummy Pages</h3>
        <p>
            Dummy Pages were added to give the illusion of a much more advanced website.<br>
            I made the mistake of copy pasting the first build. When I wanted to change something a few hours later, I had to copy all of the content again.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Infopanel</h3>
        <p>
            Stretching the website horizontally made it look a bit empty, so I added an infopanel on the right.<br>
            I used a lot of code from the sidenav but that needed a lot of refactoring. The panel holds information about social links and another project of mine for '<a href="https://github.com/HansHar/COVID-19-Vaccination">Informationsvisualisierung</a>'.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>
            At this point I already created a Github repository for the code to be on the safe side and get a version control too.<br>
            So what I did was to open the website on my phone just to realize that it was a complete mess.<br>
            I made the header, sidenav and the infopanel responsive, as well as some images on the sub pages.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Authors Page</h3>
        <p>
            The authors page was the last of the three main pages to implement. Because of the requirements I had to build a complex table.<br>
            It took quite the time to get the formatting right, because of weird arrangements of the table and its cells.<br>
            But at the end I got a nice, non smartphone-friendly page to praise myself.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Future Idea</h3>
        <p>
            When the sidenav is on top of the page when visiting with a smartphone, it should not be completly visible right from the start.<br>
            Right now it isn't that big of a problem, but when there are more sub pages per language, an expandable menu is necessary. Otherwise the user would have to scroll over all navigation points first.<br>
            <br>
            Another thing to fix is the responsive design of the header. An idea would be to put them on top of each other or put the languages inside a menu button.
        </p>
